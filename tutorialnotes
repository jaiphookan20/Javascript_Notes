Javascript is a scripting language, 

High level, interpreted programming language

Conforms to the ECMAScript specification

Multi-paradigm language - can be written in a number of diff ways - object oriented, functional etc

Language of the browser/client but also can be run on the server (Node.js)
  

HOW TO ASSIGN A VALUE: LET & CONST

Two ways to assign/initialize a variable - let & const (another one, var, is no longer used)

Const is short for constant, therefore when using const - the variable has been assigned and cannot later be assigned
Each time you use const, you have to assign the value (unlike the case with let)
for eg. const name='John', const age=30; const rating=4.5

if you do 

const x=4;

& then

x=8, it will lead to an error as it cannot be reassigned

Let, on the other hand, does not have that restriction

you may assign a value when using let but not necessarily

for eg, you can do let z; here, z is unnasigned or you can do let z=5, and then later below, you can do z=9, and it won't lead to an error

TO CHECK TYPE OF VARIABLE:

for eg - let age; (undefined here)

console.log(typeof age); - it will return string

CONSOLE.LOG()

The console.log() is a function in JavaScript which is used to print any kind of variables defined before in it or 
to just print any message that needs to be displayed to the user. Syntax: console.log(A); Parameters: It accepts a parameter 
which can be an array, an object or any message

TEMPLATE STRING

Template strings/literals are string literals allowing embedded expressions

Template strings allow you to embed variables within a string - With TS - you have to use backcommas for the strings `` (below ~ sign, next to esc button)

For eg. console.log(`my name is  ${name} and I am {age)`;

const name=John;
const age=30;

console.log(hello) - output - My name is John and I am 30

TYPE OF

let z;

console.log(typeof z); - returns undefined

STRING PROPERTIES: 

const s="Hello World!"

console.log(s.length); - returns 12

CONVERTING TO UPPERCASE - variable.toUpperCase 

- In Python, variable.upper() = in Javascript, console.log(variable.toUpperCase())

CONVERT TO LOWERCASE - console.log(variable.substring())

if you want to reduce to lowercase certain specific characters of a variable:

for eg. let s="Hello World"

console.log(s.substring(0,5)) - returns in lowercase the characters with the index value between 0 to 5

SPLIT - console.log(s.split(""))

for eg const s="technology, computers, IT, code"

console.log(s.split(",")) - This is a comma between two punctuations,
returns - 

0: "technology"
1: "computers"
2: "IT"
3: "code"
length=4 

ARRAYS:An array is a special variable, which can hold more than one value at a time

Note: Python does not have built-in support for Arrays, but Python Lists can be used instead.

ARRAY CONSTRUCTOR:

eg const fruits=['apple','oranges','pears'];

console.log(fruits[1]); - returns oranges bcoz oranges are in index value 1

 
FOR, WHILE LOOPS: WATCH FROM 35MINS



HIGH ORDER ARRAYS - forEAch, map, filter


CONDITIONAL STATEMENTS - If

TERNARY OPERATOR - If

The conditional (ternary) operator is the only JavaScript operator that takes three operands. This operator is frequently used as a shortcut for the if statement.

TERNARY OPERATOR usually used '?'
 
EXAMPLE - 

function getFee(isMember) {
  return (isMember ? "$2.00" : "$10.00"); 
}

console.log(getFee(true));
// expected output: "$2.00"

console.log(getFee(false));
// expected output: "$10.00"

console.log(getFee(1));
// expected output: "$2.00"
